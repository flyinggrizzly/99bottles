# 99 Bottles

Working through [_99 Bottles of OOP_](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles)

PRs are open (and won't be closed) for each[^1] chapter, so I/you can step
through the changes commit by commit. I've tried to make the commit messages
work like thought processes in the moment, but sometimes it's just a bare
description.
